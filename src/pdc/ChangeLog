	* PDC.java (main()): Include .json files.
	(buildFileList()): Sort the files by name (or whatever their natural sort is).
	(parseProperties()): Use endsWith() instead of contains to avoid conflicts between .js and .json.  Invoke diffJSONFiles().
	(diffJSONFiles()): New method for diffing .json hepinit files.  It only finds the 1st diff in any JsonStructure because the hepatocyte_records structure is so large.  If we add other structures or other .json files in the future, we may have to change this.
	(indexOfDifference()): Copied from Apache Commons Lang library.

2016-10-13  gepr  <gepr@tempusdictum.com>

	* PDC.java: Remove commons dependency.
	(main(), buildFileList()): Remove "-d?" cli options.  Follow the way diff works and just assume the 1st 2 args are the directories to be diffed.
	(testArgs()): new method that test the args and creates the Files for testing.
	(printUsage()): Change usage to reflect the above.

	* PDC.java (PDC): Compare the JavaScript files as well.
	(buildFileList()): New method that lists files in all directories with the given suffix.
	(parseProperties()): Add argument for the list of list of files, now with .js files interleaved.  Use diffutils on both hepstructspec.properties and all .js files.
	(diffPropertiesFiles()): Don't output anything unless there is a difference.  Reformat preamble to look like regular (unified) diff output.

	* PDC.java: Import individual Classes.
	(PDC): Change argument semantics from files to directories.
	(parseProperties()): Subsume behavior into a method.
	(listContainsTail()): New method to check for String.endsWith().
	(diffTextFiles()): New method uses difflib to diff text files (i.e. not EC parameter databases).

2015-10-13  gepr  <gepr@tempusdictum.com>

	* PDC.java (printUsage()): Fix usage statement from -f1, -f2 to -f0, -f1.
	(main()): Only do the "only in" part of the loop for the 2nd file.  Don't do the diffs.
